# Moving From Conflict to Solution 

After you've shown the "why" of your lesson and got your students interested, you're ready to move on to presenting material that teaches to the learning objectives you laid out earlier in your Readme.

While your Readme has a large overall arc of beginning, middle, and end, it should also have smaller arcs where you're asking new questions, raising new problems, and resolving them. Extend the original scenario you had in your opening or present new scenarios and introduce new characters and conditions. 

Don't give your students the solution/code/answers right away. It's boring, and moreover, it won't stick. Instead, walk your students step-by-step through solving things through code, show the missteps that you can take, the errors that'll occur, and also show how to fix them. 

## Using Metaphors 

And while really going nitty-gritty into the code is great (after all, we are teaching coding), it's important to illustrate that **scenario or situation** within which we're using our code. For example, when we cover Associations in Rails we do so within the scenario of creating a blog and showing how blog posts relate to their authors. When we cover ORMs and ActiveRecord, we use the scenario of a music player that connects artists, songs, albums, and genres. When we talk about Object Orientation in Ruby, we use the scenario of students and classes. These real-world, simple examples ground what can otherwise be abstract concepts into something very tangible. 

Use **metaphors** wherever possible to connect new ideas to known concepts. 

Hereâ€™s an example of metaphors that were used when explaining methods to students:

**Metaphor** Methods are like Vending Machines. You put some sort of input in, and some magic happens, then output happens.

**Metaphor** Methods can do a bit more because they don't always need input. When your mom says to get dressed, you then break that down into underwear, pants, shirt, socks, shoes. Now she doesn't need to repeat herself

*Tip*: To show that moments of tension are happening in your lesson, use shorter words and sentences, especially as it rises to the climax where the solution(s) is/are presented.
